Today I decided to migrate the namespace of this extension

This is quite simple actually.


Welcome to my blog which looks more as an experiment for the moment.

What is going to be here? Mainly technical stuff related to my on-going projects.

I work in my daily work with products from the [TYPO3][1] ecosystem mainly with [CMS][2] but not only!
I am maintaining a couple of extensions there.

This blog is powered by [Sculpin][3], a flexible site generator. I stumbled upon Sculpin while looking around for different site generator system.
Sculpin is written in PHP and has a nice architecture on the top of [Symfony][4].
This kind of product looks quite appealing for economic, small-size website. Once the site is generated there
is no maintenance required anymore. As a bonus, it can be freely hosted on various places!

For a quick start I have been using [this repository][5] which provides a straightforward structure to start bloging with Scuplin.
