title: Moving my extensions to Github
tags:

The [TYPO3 Forge] [forge] is an interesting place that groups together a set of extensions and web resources. Unfortunately, the platform has negotiated the transition to Git with delay and many projects have moved to Github , Bitbucket and others. Added to this, the difficulty of [Gerrit][Gerrit] which is a tool pretty tricky to get started with.

To facilitate contributions on my projects, I decided to move my extensions to Github for pragmatic reasons.
