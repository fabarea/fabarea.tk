            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my blog which looks more as an experiment for the moment.</p>

<p>What is going to be here? Mainly technical stuff related to my on-going projects.</p>

<p>I work in my daily work with products from the <a href="http://typo3.org/">TYPO3</a> ecosystem mainly with <a href="http://composer.typo3.org/">CMS</a> but not only!
I am maintaining a couple of extensions there.</p>

<p>This blog is powered by <a href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a>, a flexible site generator. I stumbled upon Sculpin while looking around for different site generator system.
Sculpin is written in PHP and has a nice architecture on the top of <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a>.
This kind of product looks quite appealing for economic, small-size website. Once the site is generated there
is no maintenance required anymore. As a bonus, it can be freely hosted on various places!</p>

<p>For a quick start I have been using <a href="https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton.git">this repository</a> which provides a straightforward structure to start bloging with Scuplin.</p>
