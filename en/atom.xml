            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am developing for some time already an <a href="https://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-media/">extension</a> for Media management for <a href="http://demo.typo3.org/">TYPO3 CMS</a>, with a focus on advanced management of metadata and filtering.</p>

<p>I just added a new tool that allows to detect duplicate files. This allows for example to identify a file that has been inadvertently uploaded several times by a user and which is double in the storage. The tool produces a list that displays these duplicates, then you can select the files to be deleted.</p>

<p>This addition complements the list of existing tools. There was the possibility already identify missing or duplicate files to records in the database of businesses.</p>

<h3>With pictures</h3>

<p>Open tools panel:</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my blog which looks more as an experiment for the moment.</p>

<p>What is going to be here? Mainly technical stuff related to my on-going projects.</p>

<p>I work in my daily work with products from the <a href="http://typo3.org/">TYPO3</a> ecosystem mainly with <a href="http://composer.typo3.org/">CMS</a> but not only!
I am maintaining a couple of extensions there.</p>

<p>This blog is powered by <a href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a>, a flexible site generator. I stumbled upon Sculpin while looking around for different site generator system.
Sculpin is written in PHP and has a nice architecture on the top of <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a>.
This kind of product looks quite appealing for economic, small-size website. Once the site is generated there
is no maintenance required anymore. As a bonus, it can be freely hosted on various places!</p>

<p>For a quick start I have been using <a href="https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton.git">this repository</a> which provides a straightforward structure to start bloging with Scuplin.</p>
